            COVID-19 has had a devastating impact across the world, in terms of
            the economy, livelihoods, and of course, the health and well-being
            of people. Today, in addition to the reversal of some of our
            developmental gains, we are also faced with new challenges at an
            unprecedented scale â€“ increasing poverty, flagging economies,
            closing down of businesses, people losing their jobs, incomes and
            livelihoods, families losing members to COVID-19, children unable to
            attend school, children losing one or both of their parents to
            COVID-19, increasing instances of domestic and gender-based violence
            at home, de-prioritization of other developmental issues, among
            others.

            While we are slowly making headway in tackling the virus, the battle
            to address the damage is ongoing and could take several years, if
            not decades, to overcome.
            <p class="text-white text-font pt-2s"> Now, more than ever, there is a greater
              need to unlock significant capital for innovations and initiatives
              that address these health and developmental concerns and need
              sustainable funding, especially where the government cannot invest,
              or there is lack of funding due to other conflicting priorities.
              Some of the best and innovative solutions to address these
              challenges come from smaller enterprises and organizations that work
              at the grassroots level, within affected and vulnerable communities.
              They have the vision to bring about positive change, but at times,
              lack the resources to do so.</p>
